# UnityAndroidSpeechRecognizer üó£Ô∏è
*Created by Eric Batlle Clavero*

 A simple **Android App** made with **Unity** that implements a **Speech Recognizer** using Android's native recognizer. 

**Without** the annoying **pop-up** and the option to keep the app **listening indefinitely**, not just once.

This repository is divided in 2 parts:

- Unity Project (**C#**)
- Android Plugin (**Java**)

## Example üé¨

*In this image it is possible to see 5 results appearing on the panel after speaking to the device "this is a continuous text speech".*


## How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è

If you want to test the app, you can download the APK from [here](https://github.com/EricBatlle/UnityAndroidSpeechRecognizer/releases/download/v1.0/SpeechRecognizer.apk).

If you want to open the project and check the code, you need to have **Unity** and **AndroidStudio** installed and updated.

If you want to scratch the code:

- If you want to check **Unity
**'s project, **open the project**, select **SpeechRecognizer** scene.
Either inside the unity project or simply dragging the **.cs** classes on your editor, you have to watch on to the classes located on ``UnitySpeechRecognizer/Assets/Scripts``. 
- If you want to check the **Android Plugin** you can do it opening the solution with **AndroidStudio** or just drag the ``MainActivity.java`` class located on ``UnitySpeechRecognizerPlugin\app\src\main\java\com\example\eric\unityspeechrecognizerplugin``
